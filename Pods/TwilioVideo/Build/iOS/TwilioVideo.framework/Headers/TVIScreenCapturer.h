/**
 *  `TVIScreenCapturer` captures from a `UIView` by using UIGraphics to draw its contents to an offscreen buffer.
 *  In iOS 12.0, Apple introduced the new A8 backing store and improved color management. However, at the same time,
 *  drawing the contents of a `UIView` became prohibitively expensive with some UIView and device combinations.
 *  For this reason we are deprecating this class on iOS 12.0 and above. If you wish to capture the entire screen (or a
 *  portion of it) then we recommend that you use ReplayKit with a custom `TVIVideoCapturer` instead.
